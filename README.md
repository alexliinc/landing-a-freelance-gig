# Landing a Freelance Gig

## General Advice

You can't stick your arms out in Denver without hitting someone who needs a website. With enough profit, businesses can pay a web agency to make it for them - but this can cost a company around $200/hour. So what does everyone else do? 

Many small businesses, solo ventures, and non-profits rely on independant contractors to launch small projects, or fix parts of a larger one. Think of it like hiring a contractor for a home repair - if you wanted to fix a leaky pipe, or install a new sink, you wouldn't need or want to hire an entire construction team - just one person can do the job, for much cheaper.

## Who needs contractors?

1. **Non-profits** routinely look for volunteers to help maintain or make improvements to their site. It's extremely rare for them to turn down help of any kind - but don't expect much, if any, financial compensation.

2. **Solo Ventures** often don't realize they could benefit from a website, or that one could be attainable for them - this could be someone running a community/Meetup Group, an artist selling their wares online, or any number of ideas a friend of family member have. Websites don't have to be profitable to justify their existence, either - a community page where a family can share photos of their child, for instance, could be a complex side project to showcase in your portfolio.

2. **Small businesses** often can't afford to hire an entire dev agency, but still need top-quality work. They are more likely to pay, and relatively well, for an independant contractor that can jump into a project with minimal spinup. Many seasoned devs make a living this way, either by managing their own stable of companies, or by creating an agreement with an established angency that provides them a predictable pipeline.

## Where do I find them?

1. **Your Network** is the best place to start. Is there anyone you know who wants a website built? Do they need a full-stack app or just a Wordpress site? Are there any non-profits or charities whose mission you want to promote? Reach out, make a post on Facebook, and see who comes out of the woodwork.

2. **Grow your network** by going to Meetups and other professional gatherings. Not just tech Meetups either - groups for entrepaneurs and small business owners are bound to be densly packed with potential clients. See if anyone is looking for help getting their hobby project off the ground.  Alternatively, see if anyone shares your interests, and wants to help you with *your* hobby project. Specifically, these Meetups will be helpful in finding you work:

3. **Freelance Sites** allow contractors to connect with people who need work - here are some of the big ones where you can find a **small** project to feet your wet:

    + [Catchafire - Skills-based Volunteering](https://www.catchafire.org/)

4. **Open Source Projects** are always looking for contributors - it's how their code stays up to date and free. Also, employers look favorably on devs that actively try to improve the projects that sustain them. Research open source projects you use - for instance, Bootstrap or Sublime Text - and see if and how you can get involved in helping. Many projects have a public repo, with a lengthy list of issues submitted by users - why not fork/clone, fix one of them, and then submit a pull request?

## Putting This in Action

Next week, you will be asked to build a freelance project.  There are only a couple requirements:

1. It must involve someone outside of this program.
2. You must prove your contribution in some way (commit message, issue resolution, live site, just has to be clearly you providing work for someone else).
