# Landing a Freelance Gig

## General Advice

Looking for a couple pointers?  Check out [this Sitepoint article](https://www.sitepoint.com/7-tips-landing-first-client-freelance-developer/).

## Your Network

Is there anyone you know who wants a website built?  Do they need a full-stack app or just a Wordpress site?

Are there any non-profits or charities whose mission you want to promote?  Do they need help?

## Growing Your Network

Go to Meetups, and then go to some more.  See if anyone is looking for help getting their hobby project off the ground.  Alternatively, see if anyone shares your interests, and wants to help you with *your* hobby project.

Specifically, these Meetups will be helpful in finding you work:

- [Code for Denver](https://www.meetup.com/CodeForDenver/)
- [Code for Boulder](https://www.meetup.com/CodeForBoulder/) - Happening today!

## 'Trol the Freelance Sites

## Putting This in Action

Next week, you will be asked to build this project.  There are only a couple requirements:

1. It must involve someone outside of this program.
2. You must prove your contribution in some way (commit message, issue resolution, live site, just has to be clearly you providing work for someone else).
